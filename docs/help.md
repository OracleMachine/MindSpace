# 🧠 MindSpace Bot — Usage Guide

**Philosophy:** Discord is the input stream; the filesystem is the source of truth. Every channel maps to a folder in the Knowledge Base, and everything you say or drop here can become durable, searchable, version-controlled content.

## How messages are processed
- **Plain text** → Passive dialogue. The bot replies using tool-based KB retrieval, records insights silently via `record_thought`, and may proactively pop up a **reviewed proposal UI** via `propose_update` if it determines a structured file needs updating.
- **URL** → The bot will instruct you to paste the content manually for ingestion.
- **File drop** → Autoroute into a content-chosen subfolder, *or* a reviewed proposal when you @mention the bot on a `.md` file. See the next section for the full workflow.

## File drops in detail
The bot branches on a single question: **did you @mention me?** That's the explicit signal for the heavy, reviewed path. Otherwise, the drop is silent and fire-and-forget.

### Autoroute (no @mention)
1. The bot reads the file — and, for text-ish types (`.md`, `.txt`, `.json`, `.py`, etc.), a short content snippet.
2. An LLM sees the current channel's folder tree and picks a target **subfolder** + a content-based **filename**, preferring to reuse existing folders rather than inventing new ones. For binary files (PDFs, images) the LLM routes by filename alone.
3. The file is written to `<channel>/<subfolder>/<new-filename>`. Name collisions get a `-2`, `-3`, … suffix automatically.
4. PDFs are uploaded to **PageIndex** for deep document Q&A. Text files get a one-line LLM summary echoed back to the channel.
5. Everything is committed to Git with a generated message. The final path is posted in the source channel so you can see where it landed.

### Reviewed ingest (@mention + `.md`)
1. Any text in your message (minus the mention itself) becomes *advice* — optional steering for the bot. A bare `@bot` drop works fine; the bot will infer intent from the draft and the channel.
2. An LLM sees your draft, semantically-similar existing KB files, and the channel folder tree, then plans one of:
   - **`new`** — create a fresh KB entry at a content-derived path.
   - **`update`** — merge your draft into an existing file it believes is related.
3. A second LLM call produces the final markdown. If the planner picked a poor update target, the merger can reject it mid-flight and fall back to creating a new file.
4. The proposal is posted in the source channel as a **unified diff** with three buttons:
   - ✅ **Apply** — write the file, commit, and re-index.
   - ❌ **Discard** — drop the proposal with no changes.
   - ✏️ **Refine** — give the bot more instructions and regenerate against the same target.
5. Proposals live **in memory only**. If the bot restarts before you click, the buttons expire and you'll need to drop the file again.

### Edge cases
- **`.md` drop, no @mention** → Autoroute, even if your message has text.
- **Non-`.md` drop + @mention** → Autoroute, because only markdown flows through the proposal editor. Your message becomes a routing hint instead.
- **Empty `.md` drop with @mention** → Rejected with a warning — there's nothing to propose.

## Commands
- `/organize` — Scan untracked files in the current channel and semantically reorganize them. Commits the result.
- `/consolidate` — Synthesize `stream_of_conscious.md` into a structured dated article; clears the stream.
- `/research <topic>` — Generate a cited research report using KB context + web search. Saves and posts the file.
- `/change_my_view [instruction]` — Update or view the channel's root stance (`view.md`) via a reviewed proposal. Accepting a change also runs a consistency sweep across every subfolder view, emitting proposals for any child that drifts. Leave instruction blank to view the current mindset.
- `/view_down_check` — Top-down sweep of the view tree: re-challenge every subfolder view against its evidence, then check each descendant view against the channel-root stance. Run irregularly to catch drift the per-commit hook missed.
- `/omni <query>` — Cross-KB synthesis across all channel folders.
- `/sync` — Manually rebuild the vector index for the current channel (picks up external filesystem edits).
- `/help` — Post this guide to `#notification`.

## The view tree
Every folder under a channel can hold its own `view.md` — a concise stance / opinion / conclusion distilled from the evidence files in that folder. The channel-root `view.md` is the **master view**: it's the only one you can *initiate* changes to (via `/change_my_view`). Subfolder views are **LLM-initiated** — only the agent's challenger and consistency checks propose updates to them.

Every view change, master or subfolder, still goes through the **proposal UI** (Apply / Discard / Refine) for your approval — nothing about `view.md` ever changes silently. After any KB-mutating commit the agent (a) re-challenges the touched folder's local view against its new evidence and (b) walks upward and checks every ancestor for consistency. New information always propagates upward. Each conflicting level surfaces its own proposal; the tree moves toward coherence one approval at a time.

While the cascade runs you'll see a single 🧭 status message in the channel that updates in place through each step (`[3/8] Upward-reconciling ancestors from \`Research/AI\`...`), then disappears when the bot is done. Commands that touch many folders may take 20-60 seconds before reporting "done" — the status ticker is there so the wait isn't silent.

## Reserved channels
`#system-log` and `#notification` are managed by the bot. Messages posted in them are ignored. `/help` always routes its reply here to keep your working channels clean.
